# Breadth-First Search tree search
'''
commonly used for:

Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs
Exploring all nodes in a connected component
Solving puzzles and mazes

BFS(graph, start):  
    create a queue Q  
    mark start as visited and enqueue it into Q  
    while Q is not empty:  
        node = Q.dequeue()  
        for each neighbor of node:  
            if neighbor is not visited:  
                mark neighbor as visited  
                enqueue neighbor into Q

Compare BFS and DFS

Key differences BFS vs DFS:

Strategy
BFS: Level by level (all neighbors first).
DFS: Deep along one branch before backtracking.
Data structure
BFS: Queue (FIFO).
DFS: Stack (implicit via recursion or explicit stack).
Path / optimality
BFS: Finds shortest path (minimum edges) in unweighted graphs.
DFS: Does not guarantee shortest path.
Memory usage (typical)
BFS: Can hold an entire layer (can be large: O(width)).
DFS: Stores just the current path + branching (O(depth)).
When it terminates early
BFS: Good if target is near the start.
DFS: Better if target is likely deep and branching factor is large early.
Use cases
BFS: Shortest paths in unweighted graphs, level order, finding connected components breadth stats.
DFS: Topological sort, cycle detection, detecting articulation points/bridges, backtracking puzzles.
Traversal order example (graph: 1 connected to 2,3; 2 to 4; 3 to 5):
BFS from 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
DFS (one possible): 1, 2, 4, 3, 5
Completeness / termination
BFS: Complete (will find a solution if one exists in finite graph).
DFS: May get stuck in deep/inf loops without visited or depth limit.
Weighted graphs
Neither handles weights; for weighted shortest paths you use Dijkstra (non-negative) or others.
Complexity (both)

Time: O(V + E)
Space: BFS O(V) worst; DFS O(V) worst but often smaller in practice if depth << breadth.
Summary: BFS explores broadly to guarantee shortest unweighted paths; DFS dives deep for structural analysis and backtracking tasks.

A length-n sequence over {1,2,3,4} is packed into a single integer using 2 bits per position (littleâ€‘endian by position t: (x-1) << (2*t)).
Array a[] stores distance (steps) from start; a[state] = 0 means unvisited (start is set to 1 so distance = a[state]-1 when reached).
