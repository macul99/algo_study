# Breadth-First Search tree search
'''
commonly used for:

Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs
Exploring all nodes in a connected component
Solving puzzles and mazes

BFS(graph, start):  
    create a queue Q  
    mark start as visited and enqueue it into Q  
    while Q is not empty:  
        node = Q.dequeue()  
        for each neighbor of node:  
            if neighbor is not visited:  
                mark neighbor as visited  
                enqueue neighbor into Q

'''
A length-n sequence over {1,2,3,4} is packed into a single integer using 2 bits per position (littleâ€‘endian by position t: (x-1) << (2*t)).
Array a[] stores distance (steps) from start; a[state] = 0 means unvisited (start is set to 1 so distance = a[state]-1 when reached).
